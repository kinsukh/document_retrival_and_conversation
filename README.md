Starting out with the project to create a Document Retrival System for a chat application.

I am using python for this prject

the code for document retrival part is done 

need to Create a QuestionAnswer LLM for answering query with the retrived document from database

the given code is working , 

1. currently working on the process of attaching the file via upload and update it in the use databse and then answer the question given by the user ,
2. work on a comprehensive answering from the document answers as the there are relevent snippets from the documents that is 'database result' but not a clear answer so to create a conversation like answer for this 

3. make the process much faster and acurate - have to do after all desired function nality is added.

4. will update on any task or to do things later.

for now i think this will be a full stack + AI project
